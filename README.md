# Tensorflow-Network-Artist
Trains FFNN to predict the image from a given title

# Requirements
This program reguires Tensoflow

# Instructions

1. Crop test images to size specified in program.py (decault is 256x256 pixels)
2. Change each test image filename to title of image (Ex. Atlas.jpg uses the title "Atlas" as the input)
3. Place test images into /Images Folder (This can be changed in program.py)
4. Change hyper-parameters in program.py if necessary
5. Run program.py
- Type "help" for a list of commands
- Type "save" to save the network
- Type "load" to load a previously saved network
- Type "train" to train on all images in /Images folder (This can be changed in program.py)
- Type "predict" to predict an image from a given title (Resulting image can be saved)
